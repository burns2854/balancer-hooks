Open Source, community curated directory to discover and submit Balancer V3 Hooks

This repo is intended to be a single location to find all Balancer V3 hooks. Each hook contract is self contained and can be used to hook into Balancer V3 pool contracts without the need to fork or create custom pools.

To add to this, submit hooks through website form, get in contact with Balancer Maxis or Grants (grants@balancer.community), or add directly to json file.
